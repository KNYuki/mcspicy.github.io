<b>FAQ:</b></p>
Q: Im trying to get to the island, why am I having inteference?<br>
A: Someone on the island has their nookphone out, is trying to leave the airport or is currently buying/selling. Please wait before trying again.<p>
Q: I can't join the queue, it's full!<br>
A: The queue has a waitinglist capacity of 15 people and the island only allows 2 visitors at a time. This is to prevent people from being kicked from the queue and excessive long active waiting time. Please try again later to join the queue.
