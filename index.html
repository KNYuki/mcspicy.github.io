  <h1>WELCOME TO MCSPICY ISLAND</H1>
  
  <h1>Turnip Price as of - : - <br><br>
  
  » <a href="/">QUEUE IS CLOSED.</a> «</h1>
  
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  
Click the link above to automatically join the island queue.<br>
A DODO code will be provided once it is your turn.<br>
<b><br><u>NO entry fees or tips necessary! I'm usually AFK so I won't be able to pick them up.</u></b>

  <br><br><b>Repeat trips</b>: Please re-join the queue to enter the island again. As there are many more waiting to sell, do limit your trips so others can have a chance.
  
 <p>
<b>Code of Conduct</b>: 
<ul>
<li><b>Do NOT</b> leave using the minus (-) button! This can cause disruptions and cause everyone to disconnect and lose their progress on the island. LEAVE USING THE AIRPORT.</li>
<br><li>If you see a fellow visitor still selling after you're done, please don't rush to leave. Not only will you face inteference, they might be disrupted as well. Give it a moment, let's make departure as smooth and pain-free as possible.</li>
<br><li>If you see tips on the ground from someone else and the host is AFK, please don't steal them. We both know that's hella rude.</li>
